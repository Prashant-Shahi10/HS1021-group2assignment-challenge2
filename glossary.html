            <h2>Glossary</h2>
            <p>Welcome to our photography glossary. Here you'll find definitions for common photography terms to help you better understand the technical aspects of photography.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Terms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aperture:</strong> The opening in a camera lens through which light enters. It affects depth of field and exposure.</li>
                <li><strong>ISO:</strong> Measures the sensitivity of the camera sensor to light. Higher ISO settings allow for shooting in low light but can introduce noise.</li>
                <li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> The length of time the camera's shutter is open, allowing light to hit the sensor. It affects motion blur and exposure.</li>
                <li><strong>Exposure:</strong> The amount of light that reaches the camera sensor, determined by aperture, shutter speed, and ISO.</li>
                <li><strong>White Balance:</strong> Adjusts the colors to match the lighting conditions, ensuring that whites appear white and other colors are accurate.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Advanced Concepts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bokeh:</strong> The pleasing out-of-focus areas in a photo, often seen as soft, rounded highlights. Used to create a sense of depth.</li>
                <li><strong>Depth of Field:</strong> The range of distance within a photo that appears sharp. Influenced by aperture, focal length, and distance from the subject.</li>
                <li><strong>HDR (High Dynamic Range):</strong> Combines multiple exposures to capture a wide range of light and detail.</li>
                <li><strong>RAW Files:</strong> Unprocessed image files that retain all the data captured by the camera sensor, offering more flexibility in post-processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Rule of Thirds:</strong> A composition principle that divides the frame into a 3x3 grid. Placing key elements along these lines or their intersections creates a balanced image.</li>
            </ul>
